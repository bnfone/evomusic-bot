<h1 align="center"> EvoMusic - A Discord Music Bot</h1>

> This is a fork of the original [EvoBot](https://github.com/eritislami/evobot), a Discord Music Bot built with TypeScript, discord.js & uses Command Handler from [discordjs.guide](https://discordjs.guide). This version includes enhancements and additional features to improve user experience and functionality.


> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ This bot is no longer actively developed _(tbh, it never really was lol)_.**
>
> YouTube keeps making it harder (and sometimes impossible) to use their videos in music bots.  
> As a result, most Discord music bots (including this one) are increasingly unstable or non-functional 
>
> Feel free to patch things up yourself, or summon the mighty powers of ChatGPT to breathe some life back into it.  
>
> **Alternatives (aka bots that might actually work):**
> - [rustyrave](https://github.com/bnfone/rustyrave-bot) – an experimental attempt at reinventing the Discord music bot wheel  
> - [Alastor – The Radio Daemon](https://github.com/bnfone/alastor-bot) – my radio-style bot that streams from public web radios (no YouTube headaches 🎶)  
> - [FlaviBot](https://flavibot.xyz) – not affiliated or sponsored, but currently seems to be a more reliable full-featured music bot

> **Note:** For Spotify and Apple Music integration, the bot converts the provided links to YouTube links before playing, ensuring compatibility and a broader range of music availability. The [Odesli.co API](https://odesli.co) is used for that. 
> This is absolutely not the most efficient solution, but it works...


## 📋 Requirements

- **Node.js**: v18.x or later
- **Discord Bot Token**: Make sure your bot’s token is valid and that you have enabled the required intents in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.dev).
- **Spotify Credentials**: A Spotify Client ID and Client Secret (obtainable via the S[potify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)).
- Additional Dependencies:
  - FFmpeg (for audio streaming)
  - Properly configured environment for Docker if you plan to run the bot using Docker


## 🛠️ Getting Started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bnfone/discord-bot-evomusic
cd discord-bot-evomusic
npm install
```


## ⚙️ Configuration

Copy or Rename `config.json.example` to `config.json` and fill out the values.

```bash
cp config.json.example config.json
```

Open `config.json` and update the following fields (or `.env` / `docker-compose.yml` if you're using Docker):


- `TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token.
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Spotify credentials.
- `MAX_PLAYLIST_SIZE`, `PRUNING`, `STAY_TIME`, `DEFAULT_VOLUME`, and `LOCALE`: Adjust these settings as desired.
- `DEBUG` and `ADVERTISEMENT_INTERVAL` can be set to control debugging output and advertisement playback frequency.
- `PIPED_API_URL`: Set this to the base URL of your chosen Piped API instance (e.g., "https://pipedapi.example.com").
- `PIPED_FALLBACK`: Set this to true to enable fallback to the Piped API for stream retrieval if the primary method fails.

⚠️ **Note**: Never commit or share your token or api keys publicly


Then run `npm run start` to start the bot.

## 🐳 Docker Configuration

For those who would prefer to use our Docker container, you may provide values from `config.json` as environment variables.

```shell
docker run -d \
  --env TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token \
  --env SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id \
  --env SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret \
  --env MAX_PLAYLIST_SIZE=100 \
  --env PRUNING=false \
  --env STAY_TIME=30 \
  --env DEFAULT_VOLUME=100 \
  --env LOCALE=en \
  --env PIPED_API_URL=https://pipedapi.example.com \
  --env PIPED_FALLBACK=true \
  ghcr.io/bnfone/discord-bot-evomusic:latest
```

Alternatively, use the provided docker-compose.yml for a simplified setup.

#### 🐳 Docker Compose

```yml
services:
  discord_music_bot:
    image: ghcr.io/bnfone/discord-bot-evomusic:latest
    container_name: discord_music_bot
    environment:
      - TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
      - SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Alternative Solution

EvoMusic relies on several external dependencies to function correctly, and occasionally, these dependencies may cause issues that temporarily disrupt the bot's functionality. While we actively work to resolve these issues, we understand the inconvenience this may cause.

#### 🛠️ Alternative Music Bot Solution

As an alternative, we recommend trying our lightweight music bot, [Alastor](https://github.com/bnfone/discord-bot-alastor/pkgs/container/discord-bot-alastor). This bot streams music directly from public web-radio streams, ensuring reliable playback without the need for additional integrations.

You can find more details and usage instructions here: [Alastor on GitHub](https://github.com/bnfone/discord-bot-alastor/pkgs/container/discord-bot-alastor).

Feel free to switch between EvoMusic and Alastor depending on your needs!


## 🫣 My Motivation

I started using the original [EvoBot](https://github.com/eritislami/evobot) a few years ago and tried several YouTube music bots along the way. But over time, none of them really met my needs. What I was truly looking for was support for Spotify and Apple Music songs and playlists. Most bots that offered that either stopped working or required payment (and yes, I know—this one also breaks from time to time… sorry about that!).

So I thought: *Why not build my own music bot?* But that felt a bit too exhausting from scratch. Instead, I decided to fork [EvoBot](https://github.com/eritislami/evobot), which already had a great foundation and a modern Discord interface using slash commands.

At the time, I only had basic Python knowledge, so I used AI to help me customize the bot to fit my needs. Along the way, I even learned some JavaScript and TypeScript. In that sense, this project is a little bit [“vibe coded”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding?ref=evomusic) - check it out, it’s a cool concept!

What I’m trying to say is: if you have a dream (like a cool feature you want in a Discord bot), use the tools around you and just go for it. You might be surprised by what you can build.

Even though AI helped a lot, this project still takes a good amount of time and effort. So if you find it useful or fun, I’d really appreciate it if you could **star the repo** or consider [supporting the project here](#-quickstart--support). ✨
