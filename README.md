<h1 align="center"> EvoMusic - A Discord Music Bot</h1>

> This is a fork of the original [EvoBot](https://github.com/eritislami/evobot), a Discord Music Bot built with TypeScript, discord.js & uses Command Handler from [discordjs.guide](https://discordjs.guide). This version includes enhancements and additional features to improve user experience and functionality.

## 📝 Features & Commands

- 🎶 **Multi-Platform Playback:** Stream music from YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Music.
- 🔎 **Comprehensive Search:** Easily search for songs using queries and choose from multiple results.
- 🎧 **Playlist Support:** Play full playlists from YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Music.
- 📋 **Advanced Queue Management:** Skip, loop, shuffle, and remove songs from the queue with intuitive commands.
- 🔊 **Dynamic Volume Control:** Adjust volume via commands or interactive button controls.
- ⏯️ **Media Control Buttons:** Use on-screen buttons for play/pause, skip, stop, mute, and more.
- 🌍 **Multi-Locale Support:** Enjoy the bot in your preferred language.
- ⚙️ **Clear Configuration Options:** Easily customize settings such as maximum playlist size, default volume, and more.
- 🌐 **Updated Discord Intents:** Uses only the necessary intents (Guilds, GuildMembers, GuildVoiceStates, GuildMessages, GuildMessageReactions, MessageContent, and DirectMessages) to match its functionality.
- 💾 **Flexible Deployment:** Start the bot using npm or Docker with straightforward startup instructions.
- 🔄 **Piped API Fallback**: If the primary YouTube stream retrieval fails (using ytdl‑core), the bot can now automatically fall back to a Piped API instance—if enabled in your configuration—to ensure continuous playback without consuming disk space.
- 🥲 **Integrated Issue Reporting:** Submit feature requests and bug reports via our GitHub issue templates.


**Alternative Option:** For a lightweight music experience, check out our alternative [Alastor - The Radio Daemon](https://github.com/bnfone/discord-bot-alastor).

> **Note:** For Spotify and Apple Music integration, the bot converts the provided links to YouTube links before playing, ensuring compatibility and a broader range of music availability. The [Odesli.co API](https://odesli.co) is used for that. 
> This is absolutely not the most efficient solution, but it works...


## 📋 Requirements

- **Node.js**: v18.x or later
- **Discord Bot Token**: Make sure your bot’s token is valid and that you have enabled the required intents in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.dev).
- **Spotify Credentials**: A Spotify Client ID and Client Secret (obtainable via the S[potify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)).
- Additional Dependencies:
  - FFmpeg (for audio streaming)
  - Properly configured environment for Docker if you plan to run the bot using Docker


## 🛠️ Getting Started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bnfone/discord-bot-evomusic
cd discord-bot-evomusic
npm install
```


## ⚙️ Configuration

Copy or Rename `config.json.example` to `config.json` and fill out the values.

```bash
cp config.json.example config.json
```

Open `config.json` and update the following fields (or `.env` / `docker-compose.yml` if you're using Docker):


- `TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token.
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Spotify credentials.
- `MAX_PLAYLIST_SIZE`, `PRUNING`, `STAY_TIME`, `DEFAULT_VOLUME`, and `LOCALE`: Adjust these settings as desired.
- `DEBUG` and `ADVERTISEMENT_INTERVAL` can be set to control debugging output and advertisement playback frequency.
- `pipedApiUrl`: Set this to the base URL of your chosen Piped API instance (e.g., "https://pipedapi.example.com").
- `usePipedFallback`: Set this to true to enable fallback to the Piped API for stream retrieval if the primary method fails.

⚠️ **Note**: Never commit or share your token or api keys publicly


Then run `npm run start` to start the bot.

## 🐳 Docker Configuration

For those who would prefer to use our Docker container, you may provide values from `config.json` as environment variables.

```shell
docker run -d \
  --env TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token \
  --env SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id \
  --env SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret \
  --env MAX_PLAYLIST_SIZE=100 \
  --env PRUNING=false \
  --env STAY_TIME=30 \
  --env DEFAULT_VOLUME=100 \
  --env LOCALE=en \
  --env PIPED_API_URL=https://pipedapi.example.com \
  --env USE_PIPED_FALLBACK=true \
  ghcr.io/bnfone/discord-bot-evomusic:latest
```

Alternatively, use the provided docker-compose.yml for a simplified setup.

#### 🐳 Docker Compose

```yml
services:
  discord_music_bot:
    image: ghcr.io/bnfone/discord-bot-evomusic:latest
    container_name: discord_music_bot

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Alternative Solution

EvoMusic relies on several external dependencies to function correctly, and occasionally, these dependencies may cause issues that temporarily disrupt the bot's functionality. While we actively work to resolve these issues, we understand the inconvenience this may cause.

#### 🛠️ Alternative Music Bot Solution

As an alternative, we recommend trying our lightweight music bot, [Alastor](https://github.com/bnfone/discord-bot-alastor/pkgs/container/discord-bot-alastor). This bot streams music directly from public web-radio streams, ensuring reliable playback without the need for additional integrations.

You can find more details and usage instructions here: [Alastor on GitHub](https://github.com/bnfone/discord-bot-alastor/pkgs/container/discord-bot-alastor).

Feel free to switch between EvoMusic and Alastor depending on your needs!
